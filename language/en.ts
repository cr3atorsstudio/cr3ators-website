  SECTION_ACTIVITIES_FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
    " Initially, we started the community with the goal of bridging the gender gap among Web3 creators. We were trying to support women and gender-minority creators and create a place where the Web3 world would be more diverse and where different kinds of collaborations would happen. But before we did that, we realized that not many people felt that Web3 was interesting or that even I might be able to do it. One of the reasons for this is the lack of female role models in the industry. By developing Web3 products ourselves and participating in hackathons, we will increase the number of people who are interested in the project, even if only a little, so that they can develop products together with us if they wish.",

So we want to make the world of Web3 a place where people of all genders, languages, and races can collaborate with each other!",
